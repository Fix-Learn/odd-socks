# 🐛 Fix and Learn — Odd Socks challenges repository

Welcome to **Fix and Learn – Odd Socks**, an e‑commerce simulation where you step into the shoes of a junior developer joining this online store. In this challenge you’ll encounter intentionally flawed Python code that miscounts socks and produces inventory errors.

Your mission: analyse the broken logic, fix the bugs and refactor the module so that the application runs reliably and improves the customer experience.

## 🎯 Goal of this repo

This repository is part of the **Fix and Learn challenge series**.Here you will:

- Work with buggy or incomplete Python code that simulates a real business scenario.
- Practice debugging, refactoring, and writing cleaner solutions.
- Learn how coding decisions affect the business context (e.g., overselling stock, miscalculating discounts, etc.).
- Build the habit of **thinking beyond syntax** and focusing on how code supports the product.
