# 🐛 Fix and Learn — Odd Socks challenges repository

Welcome to **Fix and Learn**, a collection of coding simulations where you practice solving real-world style bugs inside different business domains (ecommerce, fintech, booking apps, etc.).

Each repository represents a **self-contained challenge** with broken or poorly written code.
Your mission: **analyze, fix, and improve the codebase while thinking like a product-minded developer**.

## 🎯 Goal of this repo

This repository is part of the **Fix and Learn challenge series**.Here you will:

- Work with buggy or incomplete Python code that simulates a real business scenario.
- Practice debugging, refactoring, and writing cleaner solutions.
- Learn how coding decisions affect the business context (e.g., overselling stock, miscalculating discounts, etc.).
- Build the habit of **thinking beyond syntax** and focusing on how code supports the product.
