# 🐛 Fix and Learn — Odd Socks challenge repository

Welcome to **Fix and Learn**, a collection of coding simulations where you practice solving real-world style bugs inside different business domains (ecommerce, fintech, booking apps, etc.).

Each repository represents a **self-contained challenge** with broken or poorly written code.  
Your mission: **analyze, fix, and improve the codebase while thinking like a product-minded developer**.

## 🎯 Goal of this repo
This repository is part of the **Fix and Learn challenge series**.  
Here you will:

- Work with buggy or incomplete Python code that simulates a real business scenario.  
- Practice debugging, refactoring, and writing cleaner solutions.  
- Learn how coding decisions affect the business context (e.g., overselling stock, miscalculating discounts, etc.).  
- Build the habit of **thinking beyond syntax** and focusing on how code supports the product.

## 📂 Repository structure
- `challenge.py` → Contains the buggy/bad practice code.  
- `tests/test_challenge.py` → Unit tests designed to fail until you fix the code.  
- `README.md` → Context, story, and instructions for the challenge.

1. Read the **Story / Context** section in the README inside each challenge.  
2. Explore the code in `challenge.py`.  
3. Run the tests with:  
   ```bash
   pytest
